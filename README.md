Pizza Place Sales Analysis project! üçï



Overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive dataset capturing an entire year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place. The dataset includes essential details such as the date and time of each order, the specific pizzas served, along with additional information on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients of each pizza.

Key Objectives:
Our main objectives in this project are to answer critical questions and uncover valuable insights:

‚Ä¢ Customer Insights: Analyze data to determine how many customers we have each day and identify peak hours for our pizza place.

‚Ä¢ Pizza Order Patterns: Explore the dataset to understand the typical number of pizzas in an order and discover our best-selling pizzas.

‚Ä¢ Revenue Analysis: Calculate the total revenue generated over the year and investigate whether there is any seasonality in our sales.

‚Ä¢ Menu Optimization: Identify pizzas that may need removal from the menu and explore potential promotional opportunities to enhance our offerings.


To achieve our objectives, Here are some of the specific questions we aim to answer:

How many customers visit us daily, and when do we experience peak hours?
What is the average number of pizzas per order, and which pizzas are our bestsellers?
How much revenue did we generate this year, and can we spot any seasonal trends in our sales?
Are there any pizzas that should be considered for removal from the menu, or can we leverage promotions to boost sales?

Conclusion
Pizza orders and revenue maintains an upward trajectory from the beginning of the week Sunday and peaks on Friday before it starts dropping, this means most people prefer to eat pizza towards and during the weekend. Most people prefer to have the Pepperoni pizza for lunch on Fridays. It is advisable to make available tables and chairs to be able to accomodate the influx of the weekend, we can also explore the option of delivery services. The Ingrdients for Pepperoni pizza should be made readily available and in large quantities on or before Fridays. Since more orders are received on Fridays, a discount policy can be introduced every last Friday of the month where a customer gets 1 extra pizza when they buy 3 and above, this will encourage them to buy more.
